accessing blob data from external systems using business connectivity services in sharepoint server 2010 learn how to use microsoft business connectivity services (bcs) in microsoft sharepoint server 2010 to access and surface blob data in the sharepoint user interface and search microsoft business connectivity services (bcs) is the new version of microsoft office sharepoint server 2007 business data catalog functionality  new features are added that help retrieve binary large object data (referred to as blob data) from external systems and make it available in microsoft sharepoint server 2010  this article describes the following the functionality that is provided by the streamaccessor stereotype that is introduced in business connectivity services how to use streamaccessor to retrieve file attachments from external systems for viewing and indexing how to write the bdc model that is required to consume blob data the built-in web parts behavior for blob data  and how blob fields can be indexed by sharepoint server search in this article's scenario  the adventureworks database that is hosted in microsoft sql server 2008 is used as an external system that contains the binary data  the bdc metadata model is created with a streamaccessormethodinstance to retrieve the blob field of type varbinary from sql server as an external content type  the blob fields are modeled as types that can be read in chunks to help business connectivity services read the stream in chunks  and not load the complete content in memory  this can help prevent out-of-memory conditions  an example of such a type is system io stream in the microsoft  net framework  an external data grid web part is configured to show the external items with links to download the blob  finally  search is configured to crawl the blobs and show the results in the sharepoint server search user interface (ui) setting up the server environment the following are the requirements to run this scenario ensure that the following is installed on in your server environment this scenario uses the adventureworks sample database to represent the external system that contains blob data  to download the x64 version of the adventureworks sample database from codeplex run the setup program to create the database the production document table is used to model the external content type that contains the blob field  the document column contains microsoft word documents stored as varbinary data types in the table the first step in this scenario is to set up the business connectivity services infrastructure in the sharepoint environment  this step includes setting up the business connectivity services service application  sites to host business connectivity services web parts  and profile pages for the external content type verify that the business data connectivity (bdc) service is running  create a bdc service application give the account that is used to access the external content type read rights on the adventureworks database and on the production document table  in this scenario  you use passthrough as the authentication mechanism in the metadata model  therefore  the identity of the user who is connecting to sharepoint is used to authenticate against the sql server external system if your deployment has the external system (sql server) installed on a server different from the sharepoint front-end web server  configure the kerberos protocol for passing the end-user credentials  or use secure store service to do a single sign-on into the external system microsoft sharepoint designer 2010 provides functionality to create external content types and save them or export them in a metadata model file  you must model the streamaccessor stereotype manually because it cannot be modeled by using sharepoint designer  to make things easier and to prepare the basic metadata  it is recommended that you use sharepoint designer to create the initial metadata model that supports create  read  update  and delete (crud) operations  you can then do additional editing in a text editor such as notepad or use any xml editor to add the streamaccessor and any other method stereotypes that are not supported in sharepoint designer in this scenario  you create the initial model by using sharepoint designer  and then manually add the streamaccessor stereotype by exporting the model and editing in notepad or another xml editor explore these links to find out more about developing solutions for sharepoint foundation 2010  sharepoint server 2010  and sharepoint designer 2010
